- Move it to your project‚Äôs **root directory**.

### 8.5 Run Migration Script  
- Execute the following Python script to migrate data from SQLite to Firestore:
```bash
python migrate_sqlite_to_firestore.py
```
‚úÖ Done! Your SQLite data is now synced to Firestore. 

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

---
## ‚òÅÔ∏è Deployment

To deploy on **Streamlit Community Cloud**:

- Ensure `requirements.txt` is updated.
- Use `secrets.toml` instead of `.env`:

```toml
# .streamlit/secrets.toml
GOOGLE_API_KEY = "YOUR_GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE"
ROBOFLOW_API_KEY = "YOUR_ROBOFLOW_API_KEY_HERE"
```

- Modify `app.py`:

```python
# GOOGLE_API_KEY = os.getenv("GOOGLE_API_KEY")
GOOGLE_API_KEY = st.secrets.get("GOOGLE_API_KEY")
ROBOFLOW_API_KEY = st.secrets.get("ROBOFLOW_API_KEY")
```

- Push to GitHub/GitLab and connect to Streamlit Cloud.

## üß† How It Works

The Kamdhenu App is designed with a singular vision: **to preserve and promote India‚Äôs indigenous cattle heritage** while empowering rural communities with technology. It serves as a digital extension of the **Kamdhenu ideology**, aligning ancient wisdom with modern innovation.

---

### üêÑ 1. Promote Indigenous Breeds

- The app offers detailed profiles of native Indian cattle like Gir, Sahiwal, Ongole, etc.
- Farmers can:
  - Learn about breed characteristics (milk yield, lifespan, region)
  - Identify their cattle using AI-based image recognition
  - Make informed breeding decisions to maintain genetic purity

üéØ **Impact:** Encourages preservation of native breeds over commercial hybrids.

---

### üå± 2. Encourage Sustainable Practices

- Farmers get easy access to:
  - Organic manure techniques
  - Water conservation methods
  - Biogas and composting guidance
  - Natural disease prevention tips

üéØ **Impact:** Reduces chemical dependency and aligns with Vedic farming principles.

---

### üí¨ 3. Empower Through Knowledge & Language

- A multilingual chatbot powered by AI helps farmers:
  - Ask questions about breed care, health, government schemes
  - Get responses in **their own language** (Hindi, Telugu, Tamil, Punjabi, etc.)

üéØ **Impact:** Makes advanced knowledge accessible to all, regardless of literacy or language barriers.

---

### üõí 4. Support Gaushalas & Local Farmers

- Users can:
  - View adoptable cows and donate to shelters
  - Support campaigns like fodder supply, medical care, etc.
  - Buy/sell cattle and farming equipment ethically

üéØ **Impact:** Connects supporters and farmers to conserve cows and promote self-reliance.

---

### üìç 5. Localized & Farmer-Centric

- The app adapts to the **farmer‚Äôs region**:
  - Translates data to local language
  - Offers weather-based suggestions
  - Logs cattle health and productivity over time

üéØ **Impact:** Ensures every farmer gets guidance tailored to their land and livestock.

---

> üôè **Kamdhenu is not just a digital tool ‚Äî it's a movement.**  
This app ensures that the principles of **cow protection, ethical farming, and farmer dignity** thrive in the digital era.


## üíÅÔ∏è Future Scope

- üì± Native mobile app with offline access and notifications  
- üõ∞Ô∏è IoT integration for live cattle health tracking  
- üõí Advanced marketplace with transport, insurance, and verification  
- üéì Farmer learning modules with regional certification  
- üí∏ Integrated UPI/Google Pay for donations and purchases  
- üßæ Government scheme auto-detection and subsidy claim guidance  
- üåê NGO, Gaushala, and state-level dashboard onboarding  
- üìä Real-time data analytics for breed trends and health alerts
